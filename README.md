==================
Curriculum for the ADI-DDC Teaching Program.

The curriculum is presently broken down into 5 sessions, broadly based on the following subjects:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery
5. Git and Deployment

The overall aim of the course is to teach a person how to build a simple, interactive website. It looks mostly at the front-end, and deals less with things like data persistence, networking, etc.

The content is aimed at middle school students, but the content can be delivered to anyone who is interested in learning to build cool websites. No prior knowledge is assumed, and the only thing required is an internet-connected computer. A simple text editor will be sufficient for the majority of the lessons.

Feel free to issue pull requests for modifications to the curriculum if you think there is something awesome that we're missing.
